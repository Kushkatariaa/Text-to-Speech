#Text-to-Speech
TTS is being used more and more frequently, from smartphone and car navigation systems to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Any text can be turned into voice using the text-to-speech technique. The text-to-speech project converts words on digital devices into sounds with the touch of a button or finger. The Python Text to Speech project is highly beneficial for those who have reading difficulties.
